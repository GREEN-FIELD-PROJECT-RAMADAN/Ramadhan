Features
Time Prayers
This feature displays the daily prayer times for your location. To use this feature, you need to allow the app to access your location. The app will then fetch the prayer times for your location from an API and display them on the page.

Adhan
This feature plays the Adhan (Islamic call to prayer) for the current prayer time. To use this feature, you need to allow the app to play audio on your device. When the time for the current prayer arrives, the app will automatically play the Adhan.

Zakat Calculator
